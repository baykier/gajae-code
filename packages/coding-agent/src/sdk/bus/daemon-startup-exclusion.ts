/**
 * Shared, hold-only cross-process startup/maintenance exclusion for the D8/D9
 * doctor daemon-service flows.
 *
 * This guard NEVER publishes ownership or service state and NEVER starts,
 * signals, or claims a daemon owner. It is purely a mutual-exclusion fence,
 * built on the same authoritative file-lock machinery every other durable
 * daemon lock in this codebase uses ({@link withFileLock}): bounded retry with
 * backoff, honoring an optional `AbortSignal`, and exact-lease release on the
 * way out (never a blind recursive `rm`, and never a PID kill).
 *
 * Why a separate guard file: `withFileLock` serializes on `<path>.lock`, a
 * name distinct from every existing canonical artifact for a service
 * (`telegram-daemon.lock`/`.state.json`/`.steal`, or `owner.lock`/`state.json`
 * for Discord/Slack). Acquiring this guard therefore can never collide with,
 * be satisfied by, or be mistaken for an ordinary ownership/publication lock,
 * and ordinary publication code paths are free to acquire their own locks
 * independently — this primitive only fences bulk-maintenance and startup
 * repair work (e.g. detaching a stale Telegram `.steal` transition marker)
 * against a concurrent ordinary `ensure`, and vice versa.
 *
 * If a caller already holds this guard, it must route any further
 * `withDaemonStartupExclusion` acquisition for the SAME `(agentDir, owner)`
 * pair through nested async work that never itself re-enters this function —
 * `withFileLock`'s underlying acquisition has no reentrant/owner-token
 * concept visible to callers, so a second acquisition attempt from the same
 * async context is indistinguishable from unrelated contention and will
 * deadlock against itself. Nothing in this module grants, threads, or
 * consults any bypass flag or ambient/AsyncLocalStorage authority to avoid
 * that; the caller is responsible for not awaiting a child operation that
 * itself needs this same guard while still holding it.
